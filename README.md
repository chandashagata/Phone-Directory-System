# Phone-Directory-System

The Phone Directory System is a comprehensive web application designed to streamline and 
simplify the management of organizational/staff/employee/client information within a 
company. This system will provide a robust platform for performing CRUD (Create, Read, 
Update, Delete) operations on professional data. As companies grow, the complexity of 
handling employee information, client information, staff data, and departmental 
management increases. Traditional methods, often reliant on spreadsheets or disparate 
software solutions, can lead to inefficiencies, data inaccuracies, and security vulnerabilities. 
This system, developed using Node.js and MySQL, provides a centralized and secure platform 
for managing all aspects of organizational efficiencies.
